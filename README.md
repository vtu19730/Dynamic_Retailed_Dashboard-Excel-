üîó Data Ingestion

All data sources are hosted on GitHub.

The data is connected to Excel via Power Query, allowing:

Direct online refresh

Automatic schema updates when data changes

Version-controlled data management

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

Data Ingestion

Load all three tables (Orders, Returns, People) using Excel‚Äôs Get Data ‚Üí From Web feature linked to GitHub.

Data Cleaning & Transformation

Standardize column names and formats (e.g., dates, numeric fields).

Merge datasets using common keys (Order ID and Region).

Handle missing values and filter invalid records.

Data Modeling

Define relationships among the three tables.

Create calculated columns (e.g., profit margin, sales per order).

Dashboard Creation

Build PivotTables and PivotCharts.

Add dynamic slicers for filters such as Region, Category, Segment, and Ship Mode.

Include KPIs like:

Total Sales

Total Profit

Average Shipping Cost

Return Rate

Visualization

Region-wise and Category-wise performance charts.

Trend analysis over time.

Top products and customers by revenue and profit.

üìä Dashboard Features

Dynamic Filters: Interactive slicers for market, region, and product category.

Automated Refresh: Updates automatically from GitHub data source.

Performance Metrics: KPIs for profit, sales, and shipping cost.

Visual Insights:

Profitability by segment

Return rates

Shipping performance

Product category analysis

üß† Key Insights (Example)

The Technology category yields the highest sales across most regions.

Critical order priorities often incur higher shipping costs.

Corporate segment customers show greater bulk order volume but lower profit margins due to discounts.

Same Day shipping mode results in higher profit ratios despite increased shipping costs.

üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used
Tool	Purpose
Microsoft Excel	Data analysis, Power Query, Dashboard creation
