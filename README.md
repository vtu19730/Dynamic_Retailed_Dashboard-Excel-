Steps:

Import the Orders dataset via Power Query.

Create calculated columns:

Profit Margin = Profit / Sales

Total Orders = COUNT(Order ID)

Use Excel formulas to calculate key metrics:

Total Sales = SUM(Sales)

Total Profit = SUM(Profit)

Total Quantity = SUM(Quantity)

Build a KPI table using cell references and conditional formatting icons to highlight trends.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Sales and Profit Trend Analysis

Objective: Identify sales and profit performance patterns over time.

Steps:

Create a Pivot Table with Order Date grouped by Year and Month.

Add Sales and Profit as values.

Insert a Line Chart to visualize trends.

Apply Slicers for filtering by Category, Region, and Market.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Category-Wise Profit Analysis

Objective: Compare profit contributions from different product categories.

Steps:

Create a Pivot Table with Category as rows and Profit as values.

Create a Pivot Table with Segment as rows and Sales as values.

Show values as % of Grand Total.

Insert a Pie Chart or Donut Chart for visual representation.

Add data labels showing percentages.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Sales by Country

Objective: Analyze and compare sales performance across countries.

Steps:
